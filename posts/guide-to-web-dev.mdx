I wanted to make note of some high-quality courses and excellent teachers here.
This is the path I took to dive into web development.

### [The OdinÂ Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
#### HTML / CSS (Flexbox, CSS Grid)

I actually came across this project in 2014 when it was first getting started and really liked it, so when I was getting back into learning again, I was glad to see that it was still around and even better! 

High quality content, all free, community-sourced, and project-based.

It also goes into either Ruby on Rails or a Node.js track, but by the time I got to the 6th project, I wanted to dive deeper into React. That was when I found...

### [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/)
#### React, Responsive Design

Bob Ziroll does a really good job with this [Learn React for free](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) course. 

He explains concepts clearly, you get to practice in the browser by yourself (using their 'scrims'), and by the end of the course, I was ready to start on my own project from scratch. Scrimba also has an active Discord community where you can ask any questions.

That is when I realized I needed to learn responsive design. I went through the 'Responsive Design' module in the [Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend), taught by Kevin Powell, and this was also quite helpful. 

That was when I jumped off into my <a href="/#project_crossword">crossword project</a> for about three months.

Afterwards, I wanted a deeper dive into JavaScript, and found... 

### [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/)
#### Advanced JavaScript

[Will Sentance](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/will-sentance/) is an amazingly engaging teacher. If I am being honest,
learning the intricacies of different programming languages is not a passion of mine, but I was riveted the whole time.

I went through his [JavaScript: The Hard Parts, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts-v2/) and [The Hard Parts of Servers & Node.js](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/servers-node-js/). 

#### To Do

I've also started watching:

* [Website Accessibility, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/accessibility-v2/), with Jon Kuperman
* [Design for Developers](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/design-for-developers/), with Sarah Drasner
* [Design Systems with React & Storybook](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/design-systems/), with Emma Bostian

All the Frontend Masters courses I have looked at so far have been really high quality. 

Other things on my to-do list:
* [Modern Search Engine Optimization (SEO)](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/modern-seo/), with Mike North
* One of the [TypeScript](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/?q=typescript) courses

I'll update this as I go through them!
