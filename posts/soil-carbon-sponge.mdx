I just listened to a mind-blowing podcast episode: [Rebuilding the Soil Carbon Sponge and Cooling the Climate Fast with Walter Jehne](https://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/rebuilding-the-soil-carbon-sponge-and-cooling-the-climate-fast-with-walter-jehne). It is from the Regenerative Agriculture podcast, where grower John Kempf interviews **Dr. Walter Jehne**, an Australian soil microbiologist. It's from 2019, so I'm a little late to the party, but I am so excited that I have to share. 

I've always been drawn towards nature-based solutions, since it just makes intuitive sense that if what got us here in the first place was the human disturbance of natural feedback loops in our ecosystems, then the way back would be to actually work with these feedback loops instead. They would be the most powerful levers we could use, as they would work on an earth-systems level at the scale of the climate crisis. So when I would hear the terms "regenerative agriculture" and the practices that are associated with it: diversifying crop rotations, planting cover crops, retaining crop residues, reducing tillage frequency and depth, eliminating synthetic chemicals, etc.<sup style={{ fontSize: "70%" }}>1</sup>, I would be interested. But at the same time, I didn't really understand how we knew that these practices really worked. 

I loved this podcast episode, because it ties so much of the underlying mechanisms together to give you a whole-picture paradigm of *why* these are the practices that work and not just *what* the practices are. This is just the beginning of my understanding, but it's given me a place to start asking the right questions. For this post, I'm basically just going to do my best to transcribe the salient points of the conversation with some links to other resources that go into more detail about things Dr. Jehne mentioned.

The basic idea though, is when we talk about the need for carbon sequestration, it is not just about the CO<sub>2</sub> in the air. That is not what the actual problem is. It is a symptom of the underlying problem, which is the imbalance of the Earth's hydrology, and in fact, we should be thinking of CO<sub>2</sub> as just another resource in the hydrological system.

#### Hydrology Cycle: Nature's Temperature Regulator

**John**: *Walter, what led you to start looking at the impacts of water on atmospheric temperatures and considering a different narrative rather than [just considering] CO<sub>2</sub> as the primary greenhouse gas?* 

**Walter**: *Climatology 101 makes a simple, undeniable point: water governs 95% of the heat dynamics of the blue planet and has done so for the last 4.2 billion years. It's a foundational principle of atmospheric physics and the Earth's climate. The CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse component, which I must stress, is absolutely real, but it represents less than 4% of the heat dynamics of the blue planet.*

*Nature has evolved a hydrological balance that has both warmed the planet - it has made it 33 centigrade warmer than it would be if it were just an inert physical body in space in this part of the solar system. The natural greenhouse effect due to water vapor makes it 33 degrees warmer, but it's also our disturbance of 95% of that heat dynamic process that has now caused abnormal warming in the last 250-odd years...*

*The CO<sub>2</sub> rise is a symptom of our disturbance of the biosystem, from our excess oxidation of carbon from the biosystem, but the actual thing that is driving climate change is that land degradation on the hydrological dynamics of the planet. And so the challenge is not just to draw down the carbon dioxide - or see it as a pollutant - which is just silly. The point is it's our resource, that it is a building block we need to take to rebuild our landscape, our soils, so that we rebuild the hydrology we disturbed, and in rebuilding the hydrology, restabilize the climate, cool the climate, safely and naturally in the next 10 years. If we leave it any longer, it is very, very serious, dangerous, and damaging.*

We will have to reduce CO2 for the simple reason that we have to rebuild the earth's soil-carbon sponge. That's where the bridge between carbon management and hydroloy management really hits the ground. That is our unique point of agency, that is what we have destroyed. We have destroyed the soil-carbon sponge, in that process, we put co2 in the atmosphere, we have ridified(?) reduced the amount of water available. You like co2 because you get fertilizer effect but only if you have soil water. Without water, whatever co2 up there is no use whatsover. 
Without water, there is no life. 

9:00
Here is a symptom - co2 has gone up. take co2 as resource. the cement to rebuild the healthy soil structures. Cathedrals, voids, surfaces in healthy soils. It's where water is able to be inflitrated, retained, that's where productivity, resilience comes from. 

As far as the extremes that we are facing, we are not going to die from co2. We are going to die if we ridify and don't have the water for life or food that we need to produce. 

9:57
The point of the sponge is that is the thing that is critical to buffer the extreme. The sponge allows us to inflitrate water in the soil, minimize flood peaks, minimize erosion storm damage, source where we can sustain the longevity of green growth. Dry periods, only the water in our sponges and in-soil reservoirs that allows life to extend over those dry periods. 

10:55
The sponge is the point of agency in nature, and our only point of agency to rebuffer and stabilize these extremes. Its the extremes that are going to destroy us and destroy biosystems and kill people. Hurricans, floods, aridification. All prevented by buffering through the sponge. 

11:52
Its the longevity of green growth that governs the whole health of the biosystem and food production. Capacity to sustain over time enough water supply from the soil to maintain that crop finishing, that pasture growing. If we have sponge, save 1 inch of rain, water infilitrates and made available over 100 days. If we concrete that catchment and degrade that sponge, if we have a hard compacted soil, it basically runs out of water out of 5-10 days or less. It runs off the roads. So we have 1000% increase in productivity, 10-fold longevity increase in green growth from maintaining the sponge. 

14:03 
John: How does improvement in soil-water holding capacity contribute to stable and cooler climate?

14:21
Every time a tree or plant transpires, it takes water from soil and turns it from liquid to gas (water vapor - transpires). To do that, every gram of water needs 590 calories of heat energy to make that transformation. Called latent heat of vaporization. That heat comes from the surface soil, surface environment. So every gram of cubic centimeter of water that is transpired, cools the surface 590 calories of heat energy. There's vast quantities of transpiration taking water up into the air over long periods of time. Massive, natural, safe cooling effect. By degrading our landscape, we are limiting that natural air conditioning cooling effect of the planet. Immediately, shortening productive green growth results in a warmer surface.

Globally, some 25% of the incident solar radiation coming from the sun is naturally transferred from the surface back up into the atmosphere through these transpirational latent heat fluxes. 

Nature buffered, self-regulated. Photosynthesis would slow down, transpiration slow down, natural homeostasis.

Increase transpiration by 4-5%, offset abnormal warming.

18:05
Another part. Clouds, high albedo reflective clouds reflect up to 1/3 of solar radiation back out to space so heat doesn't even reach the Earth.
2% increase in cloudiness would offset abnormal warming.
If we don't have sponge, we don't have the water to transpire into the air to pool clouds, to drive these cooling processes. If we concrete the catchment, we end up like Mars, and we don't have any of these cooling capabilities. 

19:30
Nature has governed the temperature balance of this planet through evolving two very sophisticated opposing processes that either warm the planet or cool the planet. We've talked about the Water vapor going up from the trees which cools the surface but that water when it goes into the atmosphere condenses and releases that energy that forms haze micro-droplets. Haze is billions/trillions of these micro-droplets. To for ma micro-droplet, water has to condense onto some aerosol particle. In nature, this is James Lovelock work in the 1960s, in nature, produces a lot of these aerosols from plants and vegetations, the dimesal sulfide from marine algae, the isoprenes from forests, the pineds, turpenes from forests so nature is producing a lot of these aerosols and they actually create the hazes and they provide a natural warming effect in the atmosphere.

We have massively increased the amount of aerosols that are now in the atmosophere. 5 billion hectares of manmade desert and wasteland on this planet. Only 14 billion hectares land in total, so 40% of the land surface is now desert and wasteland which produces some 4-5 (45) billion tons of dust particles that enter the air every year, acting as haze particulates. Every year, we burn 400 million hectares of forests and some 2 billion hectares of grassland on this planet,  carbon particulates from that fire is going into the atmosphere and increasing haze. Every year we burn 8 billion tons of fossil fuels - carbon particulates and polyaeromatic hydrocarbons entering the air. Massive increase in aerosol release. Consequence level and density of the human hazes have a warming effect. Pollutant brown haze stretches from Cairo to Beijing. 

Humid hazes heat that area 50 deg temp, 95% relative humidity, well exceeding capacity for mammals including humans to survive, we cannot transpire, cool ourselves.

Nature has evolved exquisite process.
Hydroscopic precipitation nuclei.
Nature takes molecules in the air which absorb and coalesce a million of these haze droplets to make a cloud droplet. Coalesce hazes into dense high albedo clouds and these couds reflect sunlight and kill the planet.
Simple matter of coalescing hazes into clouds, nature can switch from warming to cooling process.
Balance of microbial hydroscopic nuclei that nature has regulated the temperature of the atmosphere.

3 components:
- ice crystals: critically important at high altitudes
- salt: sodium chloride over the oceans
- drives over 1/2 the rainfall particularly in tropics are bacteria: produces in somatal cavity of certain trees which go up into the air as part of the transpiration stream, nucleate these hazes, that form dense clouds and then rain, basically drive the whole hydrological cycle. 

nature has evolved a way to bring it back down as clodus and rain ando nly then does it have regulation.

Produced by certain forests. Destroying those forests have massive effect.
Lots of hard evidence. forest destruction has crushed rainfall in a region.
Aridify regions. 

Rebuilindg balance between hazeaerosols and removal by precipitation nuclei is fundamental balance that we have to restore.

26:55
Practical, very rapid ways that we can and must do this.
1. Maintain soil cover. Maintain vegetation, protective cover on soil as nature had. When we have bare, exposed soil to heat, wind that we get dust, 4 billion tons of dust aerosols that we can reduce on the planet. The more ground cover, the more ground insulation, we can do that practically everywhere.

2. Stop massive fires. Put in more carbon dioxide in the air than fossil fuels. Carbon particulates.

3. Reduce fossil fuel use. Polyaromatic hydrocarbons coming from there.

We are triggering aridification there is less ice nuclei.
Restore natural forests that produce up to a billion tons of bacteria - protoplasm pumped in that go into the air every year. Used to have 8 billion hectares of primary forest 10,000 years ago. We have cut 6.3 billion hectares of that forest, some of it is generated, so now we have 3.5 billion hectares of forest. We have massively disturbed and reduced the amount of these hydroscopic precipitation nuclei. 
Changed cloud formation capacity. More seriously, changed the rainfall induction.
Hlaf of the rainfall driven by these bacterial nuclei in symbiotic process.
We all know trees and plants need rain. But rain needs trees.

Arabacta orogenies - louis pasteur in 1870s fundamental groundbreaking sampling air top of mount blanc, open jar, collected air, looked at bacteria in it. 

Hydrology of atmosphere is driven by microbes and vegetation

Atmosophere is all about atmospheric physics, dead sense. We're saying no it's microbiology, that drives so much of the climate.

Charles Darwin and Hooker( president of royal brotan) 1880
ascension island in middle of atlantic ocean,
revegetate islands.
Bald Mountain
Green Mountain. revegetated forests 140 years ago. Now gets 20% more rainfall than Bald Mountain. 10km apart. 
Restoring forest creates rain. 

34:28
Anecodoal evidence
Los gabiotos in Colombia
regenerative farms that have significantly changed rainfall in local environment with relatively small amount of trees, a few sq km or less, in many cases quite a bit less

Please, pleas don't say this is not hard evidene. This is reality. That's nature. That's reality. Don't let anyone bluff you that that isn't evidence. Nothing is more solid evidence as nature. Just b/c it's not in somebody's computer model, don't ever doubt nature, back nature, b/c that is reality ,that is what nature is doing, that's where the answers are. What you just said is actually the proof. Don't doubt yourself. THat's where evidence is. It's not in somebody's assumptions. It's in a sense problem we got .Conventional science says not proven, not proven. No sorry ,reality has been proven. Reality is reality. 

John: We collectively have enough experience that even while the evidence may not yet be quantified and published in peer reviewed literature we are in sitaution where we need to take the experience that we already have and apply it we can't afford to take another 10 or 20 years to first quanitfiy and first validate it. We need to begin immediately with what we already know. 

Walter: Let me just say: It is validated. THere is nature. Yo uare standing in it. You don't need some computer model to guess at it. If you have people whoh ave documented, yes, we have reforested this area, we have had these hydrological effects, that is reality, that is the evidence. I am so passionate about backing reality, backing the innovators in the field, because that is the frontline knowledge, understanding, and actually saving this planet.

Trees are actually beneficial. They stop the dessication, the evaporative, windspeed, scouring where you're losing
50-60% of moisture you got. THey are saving moisture, not taking moisture away.
They create much more palatable vegetation under them. Rather than having pasture that is sclara climate (?) efectevily cardboard, you've got paaltble, nutritious.. 80%90% dry weight 400% palatibility feed conversion weight. Trees pumping nutrients from depths. Bringing nutrients into surface soil cycles. Increasing biofertility of those pastures.
Integrate shelter woods. Massively important particualrly in dry areas and as regions dessicate.
50 trees per hectare. 20-30 trees per acre. Very powerful in building resilience 

Giving you lifeboat that can survive.

39:25
We've got now recongition globally and peopel are talking about lets plant a billion trees. Give them 1-00 marks for aspiration and 5 marks fro reality. b/c planting a tree unless its got water and right soil environment.. the probablity that its going to be dead in 3 weeks 4 weeks... we've got to rebuild the sponge, the hydrology, only then will planted trees survive.. 

if we rebuild the sponge the hydrology, then mostly trees will naturally regenerate from seed from adjacent areas. 

Just by rebuilding the sponge, then allowing natural successional regenration of trees and grasses and shrubs to move into that area. 

If there is water there, life will follow, sure as eggs, no question.

That becomes the issue. How do we not just look at where we are above the surace and say hey we want this tree cuz that's what we can see
It's actually respecting what's down under, whats in the soils, the hydrology, the nutrition, the microbial diversity, b/c once we have that, trees come automatically.

41:11
John: We can't have sterile fence rows. Discontinue idea of clean field. Clean field borders.

Walter: Concepts like nomadism. we've Imprisoned ourselves in 19th 20th century in  these fencelines. 4 pegs, this is our land, we've tried to overexploit that land til we die. We mostly will die if we stay there. We've got to change that. Whole concept of fences might have to go. New concept of agriculture where we opportunistically pasture crop where the seasons are, so with us we are going right back to the wisdom of first naturions people, they worked in the ecology of these system, we hae to respect and look at how to apply that wisdom partciularly in aridificying climate like australia.

we've got to foster life, foster diversity, flexibility. 

Take the carbon and build the sponge. Maximizing photosynthesis, maximizing plant growht as best you can. minimizing oxidative inputs. Excess fertiilizers, biocides. Organic debris is turned into humates and glomin by soil microbes. Let nature and microbes buld that soil-carbon sponge for us.

Nutritional ibntegrity of food we are growing depends on sponge and the nutrient availaibility on all those soil surfaces created in the sponge. We ahve massively compromoised the nutr integrity of the food we now eat and our preventive health has crashed because of that.
