I was attracted to the Ping Austin team by their commitment 
to quality, and I joined their new Cloud team as a <b>Software Engineer 
in Test</b> in 2017. 

As the platform grew over the next year, it became clear that
improving the CI/CD pipeline experience would greatly increase 
developer productivity, and I decided to transfer to the <b>DevTools</b> team as a Software Engineer to help
with these efforts in 2019. 

As our small team continued to successfully add new features and improve the platform, I became a <b>Senior Software Engineer</b> in 2021.
When our manager left at the end of the year, I decided to try my hand as an <b>Engineering Manager</b> for our team.
This was a great leadership experience, but ultimately, I missed the more technical side of the work and was ready to explore 
the world beyond DevOps.
