I am an experienced <span style={{ color: lightBlue[700], fontWeight: "bold" }}>software engineer</span> 
who is looking to use my skills to help create a more <span style={{ color: purple[500], fontWeight: "bold" }}>sustainable</span> and 
<span style={{ color: purple[500], fontWeight: "bold" }}>caring</span> future. To that end, 
I am actively looking for my next position in the <span style={{ color: orange[800], fontWeight: "bold" }}>climate</span> or 
<span style={{ color: orange[800], fontWeight: "bold" }}>civic tech</span> space. 

I am proficient in <span style={{ color: teal[500], fontWeight: "bold" }}>React</span>, 
<span style={{ color: teal[500], fontWeight: "bold" }}>JavaScript</span>, and 
<span style={{ color: teal[500], fontWeight: "bold" }}>Python</span>, 
as well as  continuous deployment processes with <span style={{ color: pink[600], fontWeight: "bold" }}>Docker</span> 
and <span style={{ color: pink[600], fontWeight: "bold" }}>Kubernetes</span>. I have been working professionally 
on the DevOps side for the past several years, so I decided to take some time to bolster my front-end skills. 
This website is to show what I have been working on!
