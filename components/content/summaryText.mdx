I am an experienced **software engineer** who is looking to use my skills to help any endeavors striving to create a more <span style={{ color: "purple", fontWeight: "bold" }}>sustainable</span> and **caring** future. To that end, I am most excited about working in the **climate** or **civic tech** space. 

I am proficient in **React**, **JavaScript**, and **Python**, as well as  continuous deployment processes with **Docker** and **Kubernetes**. I have been working professionally on the DevOps side for the past several years, so I decided to take some time to bolster my front-end skills. This website is to show what I have been working on!
