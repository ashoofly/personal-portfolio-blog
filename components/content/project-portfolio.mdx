This site leverages **Next.js** to do static-site generation for better performance. 
It uses a [**Jamstack**](https://jamstack.org/) architecture with **MDX** to provide a more intuitive and richer
blogging experience. This was also my first foray into **TypeScript** for better maintainability over JavaScript, 
and I used the **MUI** React component library and style utilities to follow and learn industry best practices 
for user experience.
