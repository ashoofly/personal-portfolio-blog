This project stemmed from me taking screenshots of the NYTimes crossword app 
to ask my friend if she knew a 4-letter word that would fit the clue 
*"‘Voulez-vous coucher ___ moi?’ (lyric in a 1975 #1 hit)”* and other such French clues.
It made me want to prove my theory that no matter how bad all your friends thought they were at
crossword puzzles individually, all their combined, diverse perspectives together could knock out 
the hardest Saturday puzzles no problem. Thus, the live, collaborative crossword puzzle was born. 

I started with a **React** front-end, 
and realized I needed better state management so later added **Redux**. For tracking friends' 
edits and cursors in real-time, I used the **WebSocket API** with socket.io. For a quick way
to verify one was playing with one's actual friends, I added Google **authentication**. I also used 
Firebase's **Real-Time Database** to persist weekly games and Firebase **Cloud Functions** to pull 
the crossword puzzle daily.
