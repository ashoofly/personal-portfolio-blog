This project stemmed from me taking screenshots of the NYTimes crossword app 
to ask my friend if she knew a 4-letter word that would fit the clue
*"___ plaisir!"* and other such French clues.
I thought - what better way to celebrate the diversity of all my friends'
unique perspectives? We might not be able to solve a Saturday puzzle by ourselves, but dagnabbit,
we could do it together. And thus, the live, collaborative crossword app was born. 

I started with a **React** front-end, 
and realized I needed better state management so later added **Redux**. For tracking friends' 
edits and cursors in real-time, I used the **WebSocket API** with socket.io. For a quick way
to verify one was playing with one's actual friends, I added Google **authentication**. I also used 
Firebase's **Real-Time Database** to persist weekly games and Firebase **Cloud Functions** to pull 
the crossword puzzle daily.
