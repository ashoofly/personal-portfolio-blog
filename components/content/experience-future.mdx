Ultimately, I decided I most enjoyed leading from the technical side. 
At the same time, I wanted to expand my skill set from DevOps to more 
**full-stack engineering**, so I took some time to deepen my knowledge 
across the stack and now have a richer skill set to offer. 

I also want to take this opportunity to more closely **align my work with my values**.
I have been concerned about the **climate crisis** for a long time now, and 
I would like to use all the **energy and dedication** I naturally bring to my job to 
do what I can to help address this urgent and complex issue.
