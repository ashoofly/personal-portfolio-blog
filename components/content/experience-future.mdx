Ultimately, I decided I most enjoyed leading from the technical side. 
At the same time, I wanted to expand my skill set from DevOps to more 
**full-stack engineering**, so I took some time to deepen my knowledge 
across the stack and now have a richer skill set to offer. 

I also want to take this opportunity to more closely **align my work with my values**.
I have been concerned about the **climate crisis** for a long time now.
Fortunately for me, people are doing work across many different industries 
to address this complex issue, which is not only an environmental one,
but a social and economic one as well. I would love to be able to harness the 
**energy and dedication** I naturally bring to my job to help bring about 
hopeful and meaningful change.
