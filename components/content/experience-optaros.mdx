After graduating, I worked at a small e-commerce consulting company 
where I was introduced to mobile development and created a 
gamified **Android** app for a large client. I also helped a rapidly expanding
local company scale out their e-commerce capabilities by
migrating their system to a more robust **e-commerce platform**.
